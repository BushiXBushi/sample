		<h3>Life:</h3>
		<p>
			Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, on July 10, <time>1856</time>.
			Tesla was one of five children, including siblings Dane, Angelina, Milka and Marica. Tesla's interest in electrical invention was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up.
			Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a writer, and he pushed for his son to join the priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences.

		<h3>Tesla vs Edison:</h3>	
		<p>
			In <time>1884</time> Tesla arrived in the United States with little more than the clothes on his back and a letter of introduction to famed inventor and business mogul Thomas Edison, whose DC-based electrical works were fast becoming the standard in the country.
			Edison hired Tesla, and the two men were soon working tirelessly alongside each other, making improvements to Edison's inventions.
			Several months later, the two parted ways due to a conflicting business-scientific relationship, attributed by historians to their incredibly different personalities: While Edison was a power figure who focused on marketing and financial success, Tesla was commercially out-of-touch and somewhat vulnerable.

			<h3>Inventions</h3>
			<p>
				Tesla was one of the most prolific and innovative engineers and inventors of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As previously mentioned, his illustrious inventive endeavors began in the 
				early-<time>1880</time>s while he was working at the Central Telegraph Office in Budapest.
				However, there is little, if any, information about attempts to file any patents for his work at this time. Tesla's first-ever confirmed patent, for the electric arc lamp, was filed after his arrival in the United States, in March of <time>1884</time>. 
				The vast majority of his patents were filed after he left Edison's employ and founded his own company, Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing. Up until <time>1928</time>, Tesla appears to have protected many of his inventions with patents all across the world.
